### Digit-recognizer-using-CNN
<br/>
- Classify Hand-written Digits on MNIST Dataset using CNN. This project is all about building image classification models using CNN on each of these datasets.

- MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a well-known dataset used in Computer Vision that was built by Yann Le Cun et. al. It is composed of images that are handwritten digits (0-9), split into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 where each image is of 28 x 28 pixels in width and height.
